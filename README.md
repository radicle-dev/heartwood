*Radicle Heartwood Protocol & Stack*

Heartwood is the third iteration of the Radicle Protocol, a powerful
peer-to-peer code collaboration and publishing stack. The repository contains a
full implementation of Heartwood, complete with a user-friendly command-line
interface (`rad`) and network daemon (`radicle-node`).

Radicle was designed to be a secure, decentralized and powerful alternative to
code forges such as GitHub and GitLab that preserves user sovereignty
and freedom.

See the [Radicle home page](https://radicle.xyz/) for general
information, and the [Zulip chat](https://radicle.zulipchat.com/) to
talk to the project.

See the [Protocol Guide](https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol) for an
in-depth description of how Radicle works.
