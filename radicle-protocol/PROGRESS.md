# Radicle Protocol Implementation Progress

## Architecture Updates

We've significantly improved the protocol architecture to follow best practices from successful sans I/O implementations:

1. **State Machine Design**
   - Added explicit state machine in `core.rs`
   - Implemented event-driven processing
   - Created action-based responses
   - Added explicit timeout handling

2. **Zero-Copy Buffer Management**
   - Redesigned wire protocol with buffer abstractions
   - Implemented incremental parsing support
   - Added frame-based message structure
   - Created efficient VarInt encoding

3. **Event-based API**
   - Added explicit Event enum for all protocol events
   - Implemented proper event handlers
   - Created clean separation between protocol and I/O

## Current Implementation Status

1. Core State Machine (Completed)
   - Protocol state transitions implemented
   - Event handling system in place
   - Action-based response mechanism
   - Timer/timeout management

2. Wire Protocol (Completed)
   - Zero-copy buffer abstractions
   - Incremental parsing for handling partial data
   - Frame-based message structure
   - Efficient variable-length integer encoding

3. Protocol Message Types (In Progress)
   - Basic structure extracted from radicle-node
   - Need to implement Encode/Decode for all types
   - Need to map to new wire protocol

4. Protocol Logic (In Progress)
   - Basic filter implementation extracted
   - Basic gossip protocol structure extracted
   - Need to complete full protocol logic

## Next Steps

1. Complete Implementation of Message Types
   - Implement Encode/Decode for all protocol message types
   - Ensure proper error handling for all message types
   - Add comprehensive tests for serialization/deserialization

2. Complete Protocol Logic
   - Finish state machine implementation for gossip protocol
   - Extract and implement remaining protocol features
   - Add thorough testing for protocol state machine

3. Build I/O Adapter Layer
   - Create adapters for connecting protocol to radicle-node
   - Ensure compatibility with existing code
   - Implement transition strategy

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests
   - Test individual protocol components in isolation
   - Test message serialization/deserialization
   - Test state machine transitions

2. Property-Based Tests
   - Test protocol properties under various conditions
   - Test serialization round-trip properties
   - Test state machine invariants

3. Integration Tests
   - Test protocol components working together
   - Test protocol interacting with mock I/O layer
   - Test compatibility with existing code
