//! Implementation of RIP-0004 Canonical References
//!
//! [`RawRules`] is intended to be deserialized and then validated into a set of
//! [`Rules`]. These can then be used to see if a [`Qualified`] reference
//! matches any of the rules, using [`Rules::matches`]. Using [`Canonical`] with
//! the first matched rule, and this can be used to calculate the
//! [`Canonical::quorum`].

///
/// This is heavily influenced by the evaluation priority of Rules. For a
/// candidate reference name, we want the rule associated with the most specific
/// pattern to apply, i.e. to take priority over all other rules with less
/// specific patterns.
///
/// For two patterns `φ` and `ψ`, we say that "`φ` is more specific than `ψ`", denoted
/// `φ < ψ` if:
///
///  1. The number of components in `φ` is larger than the number of components
///     in `ψ`. (Note that the number of components is equal to the number of
///     occurrences of the symbol '/' in the pattern, plus 1).
///     The justification is, that refnames might be interpreted as a hierarchy
///     where a match on more components would mean a match at a lower level in
///     the hierarchy, thus being more specific.
///     Imagine a refname hierarchy that maps to a corporate hierarchy.
///     The pattern "department-1" matches all refnames that are administered
///     by a particular department, and thus is not very specific.
///     To contrast, the pattern "department-1/team-a/project-i/nice-feature"
///     is very specific as it matches all refnames that relate to the
///     development of a particular feature for a particular project by a
///     particular team.
///     Note that this would also apply when the connection between the `φ` and `ψ`
///     is not as obvious, e.g. also `a/b/c/d/* < */x`.
///
/// (Note that for the following items, one may assume that `φ` and `ψ` have the
/// same number of components.)
///
///  2. If path component i of `φ`, denoted `φ[i]`, is more specific than path
///     component i of `ψ`, denoted `ψ[i]`. This is the case if:
///      a. `φ[i]` does not contain an asterisk and `ψ[i]` contains an asterisk,
///         i.e. the symbol `*`, e.g. `a < * and abc < a*`.
///         Note that this is important to capture specificity across
///         components, i.e. to conclude that `a/b/* < a/*/c`.
///      b. Both `φ[i]` and `ψ[i]` contain an asterisk.
///          A. The asterisk in `φ[i]` is further right than the asterisk in `φ[i]`,
///             e.g. `aa* < a*`.
///          B. The asterisk in `φ[i]` and `ψ[i]` is equally far to the right,
///             and `φ[i]` is longer than `ψ[i]`, e.g. `a*b < a*`.
///
///  3. Otherwise, fall back to a lexicographic ordering.
///
