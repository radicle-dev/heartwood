:manmanual: Radicle CLI Manual

== Name

rad - Radicle command-line tooling.

== Synopsis

*rad* *

== Description

The Radicle CLI is a set of tools designed for users of the Radicle
peer-to-peer code collaboration stack. The CLI provides the ability to manage
Radicle profiles and publish repositories to the Radicle network.

== Requirements

There are a few important requirements for running the Radicle CLI: first, a
recent version of *git* (*2.34.0* or later) must be installed. You can check
your installation by running *git --version*. Second, *ssh-agent* must be
installed and running. To bypass ssh-agent, it's possible to set the
*RAD_PASSPHRASE* environment variable. See the _Environment_ section.

== Getting started

Let's see how we can setup Radicle and clone a repository from the network.

Before we start, make sure that the *rad* binary is available on your system by
running:

    $ rad

This is the base command and the output will show you all available
sub-commands.

=== Creating a profile

When using Radicle for the first time, you have to create a new Radicle
_profile_. A profile is simply a cryptographic key pair associated with some
storage space on your local device. Radicle stores everything under the Radicle
_home_ directory, which defaults to *~/.radicle* on most systems.
To create your profile, run:

    $ rad auth

Follow the instructions by entering an alias and a passphrase to protect your
key pair. When you've completed the steps, your new Radicle _DID_
(Decentralized Identifier) will be displayed. This identifies your device, as
well as all the code you publish. Share it freely with collaborators. Your
alias is a non-unique name that is shared across the network to identify your
node. It can always be changed at a later time.

After running *rad auth*, you should have a new profile and key pair under your
Radicle home. The key pair is used for identifying peers across the network, as
well as signing code and other artifacts published on the network.

To avoid having to re-enter your passphrase every time a signature is required,
*rad auth* adds your secret key to *ssh-agent*.

You can always display the full path to your Radicle home directory using:

    $ rad self --home

The *self* sub-command is useful for querying profile information. You can
run it without any arguments to show all of your profile information, including
your DID:

    $ rad self

=== Connecting to the network

Radicle is a peer-to-peer system. This means that there are no clients or
servers; only _nodes_, and every user has to run their own. This ensures
that there is no single point of failure, and the Radicle network can keep on
existing as long as there are users to run nodes.

The Radicle node is a lightweight process that runs in the background and
manages connections with other nodes, as well as data replication. To check your
node's status, run:

    $ rad node status

If the node is not running, you can start it with:

    $ rad node start

This will start the node in the foreground. Simply add *--daemon* to run the
node in the background.

When daemonized, the node will log all output to a file under your Radicle home.
On most systems, this will be *~/.radicle/node/node.log*.

You can also display the latest logs at any time using:

    $ rad node logs

After your node starts, it will attempt to connect to peers on the network.

Note that if you set up your node to be started using **systemd**(1),
the logs will go to the system journal. These can be viewed with **journalctl**(1):

    $ journalctl -u radicle-node -S today

To connect to a specific peer, the *connect* sub-command can be used:
For example, to connect to a community node, you can run:

    $ rad node connect z6MkrLMMsiPWUcNPHcRajuMi9mDfYckSoJyPwwnknocNYPm7@iris.radicle.xyz:8776

The argument given to *connect* is called a node _address_. It is composed of
a Node ID (NID), followed by an *@* symbol, and the _host_ name and _port_.
You can display your NID with *rad self --nid*.

To make these connections permanent, such that they are always tried on
startup, add the addresses to your configuration file at
*~/.radicle/config.json*, under the *"connect"* field.

Now that you're connected to the network, we can try to clone a repository
hosted on Radicle.

=== Cloning a repository

To clone a repository from the Radicle network, you need to be connected to a
seed which is hosting the repository. Eventually, this won't be necessary,
but for now, a direct connection with the seed you are cloning from is
required. Once the connection is established, you can run the *rad clone*
command to clone a repository, by supplying a Repository Identifier (RID).
RIDs are globally unique URNs that identify a repository on Radicle.
For example, let's clone the Radicle heartwood repository:

    $ rad clone rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5

If the command succeeds, you will have a checkout of the repository under
*./heartwood*, with a *rad* remote setup, which you can pull from and push to.

The *rad* remote is special in that it will always return the _authoritative_
branch of the repo, when fetched from. This is defined as the latest commit
on the repository's default branch that a threshold of delegates have published.

Under the hood, the *clone* command does a few important things:

* It subscribes to updates from this repository; this is called _tracking_.
* It creates a copy of the repository under your local storage, which provides
  a replica to the network.
* It creates a Git remote for every repository _delegate_. These are usually
  the repository maintainers.
* It creates a fork of the repository that is under your public key.
* It creates a *rad* remote which you can push to, to update your fork.

You can see all replicated and locally-available repositories using:

    $ rad ls --all

By default, your node will subscribe to updates from _all_ peers. This
behavior can be changed by passing *--scope followed* when cloning. It can
also be changed later via the *rad seed* command.

=== Publishing a repository on Radicle

To publish an existing Git repository on the Radicle network, navigate to
a working copy and run the *rad init* command:

    $ cd my-repo
    $ rad init

You will be prompted to enter a repository name and default branch. Once the
repository is created, the Repository Identifier (RID) will be printed.
Share this with collaborators so that they can clone your repository.

Note that your new repository will only be replicated by nodes that you are
connected to and either have an open tracking policy, or trust your Node ID.

The *rad init* command creates a special remote in your working copy named
*rad*. Pushing to this remote publishes changes to your local storage and to
the network.

You can view information about the *rad* remote with:

    $ git remote show rad

You can display the Repository ID (RID) from the root of any Git repository
by running:

    $ rad .

You can also show the repository's identity payload, which contains its name,
description and default branch by running:

    $ rad inspect --payload

== Files

*~/.radicle*::

The _Radicle Home_. This is the default location for Radicle configuration
files, keys, and repository storage. Can be controlled by settting the
**RAD_HOME** environment variable.

*~/.radicle/config.json*::

The default configuration file for Radicle. To display its exact
location on your system, you can use the *rad self --config* command.

== Environment

Various environment variables are used by *rad*.

*RAD_HOME*::

This sets the location of your Radicle home. If unset, your Radicle home will
be located at *~/.radicle*.

*RAD_PASSPHRASE*::

If you would like to bypass *ssh-agent*, you can store your passphrase in this
environment variable. Note that this is not secure and is equivalent to having
an unencrypted secret key.
