At some point in the lifetime of a Radicle project you may want to
collaborate with someone else allowing them to become a project
maintainer. This requires adding them as a `delegate` and possibly
editing the `threshold` for passing new changes to the identity of the
project.

For cases where `threshold = 1`, it is enough to use the `rad
delegate` command. For cases where `threshold > 1`, it is necessary to
gather a quorum of signatures to update the Radicle identity. To do
this, we use the `rad id` command.

Let's add Bob as a delegate using their DID
`did:key:z6MkedTZGJGqgQ2py2b8kGecfxdt2yRdHWF6JpaZC47fovFn`.

```
$ rad id edit --title "Add Bob" --description "Add Bob as a delegate" --delegates did:key:z6MkedTZGJGqgQ2py2b8kGecfxdt2yRdHWF6JpaZC47fovFn --no-confirm

Before moving on, let's take a few notes on this output. The first
thing we'll notice is that the difference between the current identity
document and the proposed changes are shown. Specifically, we changed
the delegates:

    "delegates": [
    -    "did:key:z6MknSLrJoTcukLrE435hVNQT4JUhbvWLX4kUzqkEStBU8Vi"
    +    "did:key:z6MknSLrJoTcukLrE435hVNQT4JUhbvWLX4kUzqkEStBU8Vi",
    +    "did:key:z6MkedTZGJGqgQ2py2b8kGecfxdt2yRdHWF6JpaZC47fovFn"
    ],

Next we have the number of `Accepted` reviews from delegates, starting
off with none:

    Accepted

    total: 0
    keys: []

The same with `Rejected` reviews:

    Rejected

    total: 0
    keys: []

Finally, we can see whether the `Quorum` was reached:

    Quorum Reached

    üëé no

Let's see what happens when we reject the change:

Our key was added to the `Rejected` set of `keys` and the `total`
increased to `1`.

Our key has changed from the `Rejected` set to the `Accepted` set
instead:

    Accepted

As well as that, the `Quorum` has now been reached:

At this point, we can commit the proposal and update the identity:

Let's say we decide to also change the `threshold`, we can do so using
the `--threshold` option:

```

 }

But we change our minds and decide to close the proposal instead:

```

   },

 }

The proposal is now closed and cannot be committed. If at a later date
we want to update the document with the same change we have to open a
new proposal.

If at any time we want to see what proposals have been made to this
Radicle identity, then we can use the list command:

```
$ rad id list
0d396a83a5e1dda2b8929f7dc401d19dd1a79fb8 "Add Bob"          ‚ù≤committed‚ù≥
f435d6e89c8f922ede691287c0d8b7f82afa591e "Update threshold" ‚ù≤closed‚ù≥
```

And if we want to view the latest state of any proposal we can use the
show command:

```
$ rad id show f435d6e89c8f922ede691287c0d8b7f82afa591e

On a final note, these examples used `--no-confirm`. The default mode
for making proposals is to select and confirm any actions being
performed on the proposal.
