Initializing your radicle ðŸ‘¾ identity

âœ“ Creating your identity repository...
âœ“ Your Radicle DID is did:rad:z[..]. This identifies you. Run `rad did` to show it at all times.

âœ“ Creating your Ed25519 controlling keypair...
âœ“ Signing inception event...

  Controlling Keys:
    Public: did:key:z6MK[..]
    Secret: ~/.radicle/did/[..]/control/0

âœ“ Creating your Ed25519 signing keypair...
âœ“ Rotating in your signing key...

  Signing Keys:
    Public: did:key:z6MK[..]
    Secret: ~/.radicle/did/[..]/sign/0

âœ“ You're all set.

âœ— Hint: install ssh-agent to have it fill in your passphrase for you when signing.

To create a Radicle repository, run `rad init` from a Git repository with at least one commit.
To clone a repository, run `rad clone <rid>`. For example, `rad clone rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5` clones the Radicle 'heartwood' repository.
To get a list of all commands, run `rad`.
```

You can get the above information at all times using the `self` command:


```
$ rad did list
did:key:z[..]
```

```
$ rad did
did:key:z[..]
```

You can also show your alias:

```
$ rad self --alias
alice
```
